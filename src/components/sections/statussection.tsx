        Status: Active but invisible. Currently between projects and possibilities, 
        maintaining servers that exist in the spaces between documentation. 
        The code compiles, the tests pass, but something deeper lurks in the architecture.

        Last deployment: Success with warnings. Next iteration: Unknown. 
        The repository holds more than just source codeâ€”it contains the digital DNA 
        of systems that breathe on their own.
